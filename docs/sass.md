## SCSS

In our WSK you can use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

Sass is a CSS preprocessor—a layer between the stylesheets you author and the .css files you serve to the browser. Sass (short for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) plugs the holes in CSS as a language, allowing you to write DRY code that’ll be faster, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

So while normal CSS doesn’t yet allow things like variables, mixins (reusable blocks of styles), and other goodies, Sass provides a syntax that does all of that and more—enabling “super functionality” in addition to your normal CSS.  

* All custom **scss** files locate in `src/scss/` folder;
* Entry point for all scss is `src/scss/style.scss` you can **import** all your *.scss* files from here;
* You **don't need** to write **prefixes** for different browsers like `-webkit` it will be done by the gulp.

The `src` directory above contains MDL's Sass files and the JavaScript sources for all MDL components.

* All **extensions** must be installed by the [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install);
* After installing the extension you must **include its files**:
  * **css or sass files** must be included in `src/vendor_entries/vendor.scss` using `@import`.
